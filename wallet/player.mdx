## Responsibility of the wallet platform
<Warning>
    Assert that the incoming playerToken is valid, and return the playerID that is connected to the playerToken; this step is necessary in order to validate a player. The playerID that is returned must be unique per player, and identical each time an individual player authenticates.
    The wallet platform also has a choice whether to return a sessionId value that is identical to the playerToken from the request, or a new operator generated identifier. RGS will use the returned sessionId value in all subsequent Get Balance, Credit, Debit and Rollback requests for this game session.
