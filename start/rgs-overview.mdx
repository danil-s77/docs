## Overview

The RGS API is designed to facilitate both game launching and the retrieval of essential metadata that supports a rich gaming environment. The endpoints fall into two main categories:

### 1. Game Launch

- **Endpoint:** `GET /games/launch`
- **Purpose:**
This endpoint initiates a gaming session by either creating a new player (if the provided player token does not exist) or opening a session for an existing player. Upon successful execution, it redirects the client to the appropriate game URL.
- **Usage:**
Use the game launch URL to start a game directly. This endpoint supports customization options such as specifying the device type, language, lobby URL, and currency, ensuring that the session is tailored to the player’s needs.

### 2. Supporting Metadata Endpoints

These endpoints provide valuable information that enhances the gaming experience by enabling better content presentation and localization:

- **Get Software Providers (`GET /software-providers`):**
Retrieves a list of all software providers integrated with the system. This is useful for filtering games and displaying provider options within your platform.

- **Get Games (`GET /games`):**
Returns a list of available games. You can filter this list by a specific software provider if desired. This endpoint is essential for populating your game library and offering players a wide selection of titles.

- **Get Languages (`GET /languages`):**
Provides a list of supported languages. This endpoint can be used to tailor the gaming interface and ensure that content is presented in the player’s preferred language, enhancing the overall user experience.
