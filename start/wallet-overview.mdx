title: "Wallet API Overview"
description: "This document provides an overview of the core API endpoints for the RGS backend. These endpoints manage player sessions, balance retrieval, and transaction operations (credit, debit, and rollback). The concept of idempotency is also explained to ensure reliable transaction processing."

## API Endpoints

This section outlines the primary API endpoints used in the RGS system:

### 1. Get Player Session
- **Endpoint:** `GET /session`
- **Description:**
Initiates a player game session using a provided player token and game UUID. Returns a unique player ID, session ID, and the currency code associated with the player's account.

### 2. Get Balance
- **Endpoint:** `GET /balance`
- **Description:**
Retrieves the current balance for a player based on their unique player ID, session ID, game UUID, and currency code.

### 3. Credit
- **Endpoint:** `POST /credit`
- **Description:**
Adds a specified amount to the player's balance as part of a game transaction.
**Idempotency:** This operation is idempotent, meaning that repeated requests with the same `transactionId` will not result in additional credits beyond the first successful request.

### 4. Debit
- **Endpoint:** `POST /debit`
- **Description:**
Debits a specified amount from the player's balance as part of a game transaction.
**Idempotency:** This endpoint is designed to be idempotent, ensuring that if the same debit request (identified by its `transactionId`) is submitted more than once, only one debit is applied.

### 5. Rollback
- **Endpoint:** `POST /credit/rollback`
- **Description:**
Reverses a previously credited amount from the player's balance, effectively rolling back a wager.
**Idempotency:** This operation is idempotent so that multiple requests with the same `transactionId` do not result in multiple rollbacks.

With these definitions in mind, the following sequence diagrams provide a detailed look at the core operational flows within the RGS ecosystem. They illustrate how players, operators, and the RGS platform interact to launch games and conduct game rounds seamlessly.

## Sequence Diagram for Game Launch

```mermaid

    Player->>+Operator: Initiate game launch
    Operator-->>-Player: Provide player token
    Player->>+RGS: Execute game launch using player token
    RGS->>+Operator: Request player session using token
    Operator-->>-RGS: Return session ID
    RGS-->>-Player: Redirect to game launch URL
```

## Sequence Diagram for Game Round

```mermaid

    Player->>+RGS: Submit spin request
    RGS->>+Operator: Initiate credit request (roundStarted=true)
    Operator-->>-RGS: Approve and return updated balance
    RGS-->>-Player: Deliver spin outcome
    Player->>+RGS: Submit freespin request
    RGS->>+Operator: Initiate debit request
    Operator-->>-RGS: Approve and return updated balance
    RGS-->>-Player: Deliver freespin outcome
    Player->>+RGS: Submit additional freespin request
    RGS->>+Operator: Initiate debit request (roundFinished=true)
    Operator-->>-RGS: Approve and return updated balance
    RGS-->>-Player: Deliver final freespin outcome
```

## Idempotency in the RGS API

Idempotency is a critical concept for ensuring the reliability and consistency of transaction processing. In the context of the RGS API, idempotency means that:

- **Definition:**
An operation is idempotent if performing it multiple times yields the same result as executing it once. This prevents duplicate transactions from affecting the player's balance.

- **How It Works:**
Each transaction-based request (for credit, debit, or rollback) includes a unique `transactionId`. The system uses this identifier to track whether a transaction has already been processed. If a duplicate request is received with the same `transactionId`, the system will recognize it and return the same response as the initial request, without reapplying the transaction.

- **Benefits:**
- **Consistency:** Ensures that network retries or duplicate submissions do not cause unintended balance changes.
- **Reliability:** Provides a safeguard against errors and minimizes the risk of double processing, which is vital in financial transactions.
